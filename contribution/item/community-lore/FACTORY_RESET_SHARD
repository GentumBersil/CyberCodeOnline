"What are these? It's not glowing so normal shards??? What this written here...a serial number and R...e...s...Reset? Reset, what? Time...but its not glowing unless...ahh there it is, a slot in my equipment, the same as the shape of shard...so I put it in. Hhmm, it resets the equipment back to it's first form. Wait, rare weapon to trash weapon?! So that means, rare = rare is not true but rather trash + upgrade = common then...trash can be upgraded to epic?! But how?! Is there any shard that upgrades weapon to higher form? Wait a minute, these shards...they've been tampered like AI Cores, does it mean that these reset shards have a different purpose?! Much to think about..." [042 Explorer & Theorist]
